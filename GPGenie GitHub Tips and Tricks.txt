Anyone can add to this...let's work together to figure this tool out!

Li – I think the path to getting our source from your machine into GPGenie will be this:
1.	In GitHib, get the repository synced to local – this puts the empty DevSource directory on your machine
2.	In Explorer, Put your source project and files into that empty directory
3.	In GitHib, click this next to the repository:   and you will see your stuff in the program (?)
4.	Use the ‘uncommitted changes’ window add a Commit Message to enable the ‘commit to master’ check button
5.	Click the Sync button   in the upper right corner
6.	Use the ‘Open Repository in Explorer link to go back to your local development…
Easy, right??
